## Editing this page

This project is a plain HTML page, so there's no complex setup in order to 'run' in. However, you may find it useful to
activate the git's pre-commit hook since it will be run in the CI validation too.

Run the following command to set it up (note that CI uses node v18.16.0):

```bash
npm install
npm run prepare
```
